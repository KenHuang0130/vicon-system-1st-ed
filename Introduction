**Key Features of the Updated Script

*Threading for UDP Listener
The UDP listener runs in a separate thread to continuously receive data without blocking Crazyflie commands.

*Dynamic Control Updates
The Crazyflie command function fetches the latest roll, pitch, yaw_rate, and thrust values from shared control_data.

*Exception Handling and Cleanup
Ensures proper cleanup of the UDP socket and thread upon script termination.

*Data Scaling
The received roll, pitch, and yaw values are scaled (e.g., divided by 100) to match the Crazyflie's expected input range.
